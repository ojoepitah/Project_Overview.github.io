# PROJECTS OVERVIEW

## List Of Projects

### PowerBi Project
A curated portfolio of data analysis  projects detailing the analytical approach, statistical techniques, and key insights uncovered using tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI. They showcase my ability to work with data end-to-end and explore datasets; analyzing, visualizing, and extracting insights that support data-driven decision-making.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales_data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools
- Excel - Data Cleaning

- SQL Server - Data Analysis
- PowerBI - Creating reports

#### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis
Include some interesting code/features worked with

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:

1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

## Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
